# Personal-Projects

PURPOSE OF THE PROJECT:
During senior year, I decided I was going to code a game. This was performed by learning how Java could create a game 
and went on to become a fleshed out idea come to life. In the game, you control a character that can throw a disk. 
This disk can deal damage if it hits your opponent, with the end result being that you make your opponents healthbar become 0. 
The character can move around in an arena, with the ability to throw the disk, and can also catch the opponents disk. 
By catching the opponents disk, the player can then throw it back at the opponent to deal more damage, while moving faster.

HOW TO GET THE GAME RUNNING:
Once you have all the files on your IDE, you will run the Tron.java file. This is because this is essentially the main class
that everything in the game is linked to. If you don't have the Tron.java file, you're IDE will be riddled with errors. After
you have all the files (especially the Tron.java), run the file and have fun
